# RunToken- Sample ERC20 token Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

#### Installing dependencies
`npm install hardhat ethers`


```shell
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <NETWORK_NAME>
```
